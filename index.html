    <!-- I need to itemize the radio buttons to make this all line up. I figured with the colors it would have a high contrast.. 
      the submit button is large enough and high contrast/low contrast colors. I would also like to address the design of the questions as well so that I can space them and give them a face-lift. -->

<!-- so what I am trying to do is if you look in CSS I am attempting to add future features to create something more appealing
I have updated this to allow for Aria and A11y compatibility I would like to clean up the bordering but for now I think it should work-->
